  ## Installation
  Go to my Github link which will be provided at the bottom, download the code, make changes to your seeds folder if you'd like, update the connection for your best fit. Then run these commands in the terminal, make sure you are in the main folder
  -npm i (this is to install all the necessary packages)
  -node seeds/index.js
  -node server.js
  Then you can either run the code in the browser on localhost or use the insomnia app to run GET, PUT, PUSH, and DELETE requests.
 
  ## Usage
  You need to run your seeds/index.js file in the terminal, then start up the server with "node server.js", and then either test the code through insomnia or localhost.

  ## Motivation
  This was a class assignment that turned out to be quite fun! Very useful for whatever small database you'd like to use for a website. 

  ## Why?
  Coding bootcamp project

  "Your challenge is to build the back end for an e-commerce site. Youâ€™ll take a working Express.js API and configure it to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database."

  ## Problem Solved?
  It is good starter code for an up and coming company. Can use this as a model for a website with a database.

  ## Things Learned
  I learned a lot... I love how easy Insomnia was to use and understand. Sequelize was very nice package to work with the data, and I learned how to use dotenv variables, which is kinda neat.
